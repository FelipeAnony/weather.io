### Get started
You need to have an api key from https://weatherapi.com (Or change the api).

After you have the api key, create the file .env and put the key on it:

<pre> REACT_APP_API_KEY = YOUR-API-KEY</pre> 

Or if you prefer, change it directly on src/helpers/apiHelper.ts. After that, install the dependencies and just run 

<pre>npm start</pre>
